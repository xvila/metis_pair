    <p><h1> Twin Peaks! </h1>
      This is my first paragraph writing in HTML. This is terrible I can see why people prefer using markdown. Anyway this is what we have today so this is what we will use. I finally finished twin peaks over the weekend and I am not sure how I feel about it.<br>
      This is a line break.

        This is my second paragraph. So was everything in twin peaks for nothing? I mean I guess some of the bad guys were dealt with but now where is Cooper?
